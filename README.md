## 🍘🍜🍣 Data Cleansing 🍣🍜🍘 
After filtering, empty rows were removed and missing values in price, quantity, discount, and status were filled or deemed non-critical based on analysis.

We corrected unusual values in price, discount, and total revenue by converting them to IDR currency format, and standardized customer IDs to a six-digit format.

We identified and removed 5 duplicate rows.


## 🍘🍜🍣 Outliers 🍣🍜🍘
We will remove values in the total revenue column that fall outside the interquartile range (IQR), specifically those below 0 or above 14,107,250 million.
We identified 12 rows exceeding the upper bound, and these rows were subsequently removed.
